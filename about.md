## Description of the Manuscript

This is a mid-fifteenth century manuscript. It contains a French translation of James of Milun’s Stimulus Amoris. This translation is attributed to Simon de Courcy who dedicated the work to Marie de Berry the Duchess of Bourbon. Simon de Courcy was Marie’s Chaplain and likely translated this popular devotional treatise sometime in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. For additional information regarding the manuscript please consult the [Beinecke’s listing](https://pre1600ms.beinecke.library.yale.edu/docs/pre1600.ms1166.htm).

## Methodology 

In preparing this edition, I have sought to render the original orthography as closely as possible with several key exceptions. This edition is neither diplomatic nor critical, though it is based on a single manuscript source. Additional manuscript sources, many of which can be found at the Bibliothèque National de France (BNF), may figure in some future iteration. Rather, this is an ongoing project the intent of which is to render this relatively uncommon and understudied text accessible for free to larger audience both in transcription and in an accompanying translation into modern English.

A few simple rules have been followed:

I do not distinguish between “v” and “u” which are indistinguishable in the gothic bastarda script used by the scribe of this manuscript. 

I have conserved “i” and “j” wherever they are clearly distinct. Though in principle these letters are not distinct in this manuscript, the “j” form tends to occur primarily in the initial position. This does not prevent the scribe from occasionally employing an initial “i” from time to time in expressions such as “iay” for “jay,” “I have,” in English. 

I use capital letters in my transcription to mark several phenomena within the manuscript. Capital letters occur to replace illuminated initials, highlighted letters in the body of the text, and capital letter forms wherever they may perchance occur in the body of the text even though they are not necessarily set off by illumination of any form. 

Images of the folios have been included for comparison. If the reader requires any further information regarding the manuscript, I will refer them to the [Beinecke's listing](https://pre1600ms.beinecke.library.yale.edu/docs/pre1600.ms1166.htm).

## Translation Philosophy

For my translation, I have cultivated a middle of the road approach. While I have done my best to respect the syntax, form, and content of the original, I have nevertheless labored to make the translation legible to an initiated reader of medieval vernacular literature. A few items are footnoted for clarity.
