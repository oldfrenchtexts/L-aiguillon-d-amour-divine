## Description of the Manuscript

This is a mid-fifteenth century manuscript. It contains a French translation of James of Milun’s *Stimulus Amoris*. This translation is attributed to Simon de Courcy who dedicated the work to Marie de Berry, the Duchess of Bourbon. Simon de Courcy was Marie’s Chaplain and likely translated this popular devotional treatise at sometime in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. For additional information regarding the manuscript please consult the [Beinecke’s listing](https://pre1600ms.beinecke.library.yale.edu/docs/pre1600.ms1166.htm).

## Methodology 

In preparing this edition, I have sought to render the original orthography as closely as possible with several key exceptions. This edition is neither diplomatic nor critical, though it is based primarily on a single manuscript source. For comparison, I will occasionally reference Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF) Fr. 926, an early fifteenth-century copy of the same text. Additional manuscript sources, many of which can be found at the BNF, may figure in some future iteration of this edition. Rather, this is an ongoing project the intent of which is to make this relatively uncommon and understudied text accessible for free to a general audience both in transcription and in an accompanying Modern English translation .

A few simple rules have been followed:

I do not distinguish between “v” and “u” which are generally not differentiated in the gothic bastarda script used by the scribe of this manuscript. 

I do not distinguish between “i” and “j." Generally, these letters are interchangeable in this manuscript. The “j” form tends to occur primarily in the initial position. However, this does not prevent the scribe from occasionally employing an initial “i” from time to time in expressions such as “iay” for “jay,” “I have,” in English. I represent this initial "i/j" form with a lowercase "i" unless otherwise illumniated or emphasized in which case I represent it with an uppercase "I." 

I use capital letters in my transcription to mark several phenomena within the manuscript. Capital letters occur to replace illuminated initials, highlighted letters in the body of the text, and capital letter forms wherever they may perchance occur in the body of the text even though they are not necessarily set off by illumination of any form. 

I have expanded most scribal abbreviations, especially those that leave little room for confusion: omitted letters, nasal bars, superscript letters, etc. Any other abbreviations I have left behind on account of their ambiguity or peculiarity are explained in the footnotes.

Images of the folios have been included for comparison. If the reader requires any further information regarding the manuscript, I will refer them to the [Beinecke's listing](https://pre1600ms.beinecke.library.yale.edu/docs/pre1600.ms1166.htm).

## Translation Philosophy

For my translation, I have cultivated a middle of the road approach. While I have done my best to respect the syntax, form, and content of the original, I have nevertheless labored to make the translation legible to an uninitiated reader of medieval vernacular literature. A few items are footnoted for clarity or where I have been forced to choose between two or more potentially viable alterantives. Additionally, in my translation, I label the source text language. Thus, material translated from Latin is marked as such, and conversly French material is likewise marked.
