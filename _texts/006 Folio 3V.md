# Translation

French: ...life, particularly to pledge, join, and bring to himself in loving marriage, lovingly desiring and seeking ardent desire that you be the one, o my dearest daughter, and firm hope that it will be so, all have brought me and led me into the laborious occupation of translating and rendering *The Goad of Divine Love* (*L’Aguillon d’amour divine*) from Latin to French – not word for word, but in such a manner that, when reading it all alone, o my dearest daughter, you will avail your own soul as an instructor does his disciple. You will be before God as a wife and good friend of his son, sweet Jesus. Even so will it plainly appear in accordance with the (my) manner[^2] of (translating) proceeding. For, by reading attentively and devoutly, my dearest daughter, you will speak sometimes to your soul like an instructor to his disciple and so much so that my physical presence will not be necessary. Sometimes to God as though you were devoutly offering prayer.

# Footnotes

[^1]: The abbreviation “pñt” (with nasal bar) appears as “presens” in BNF fr. 926. The nominative singular masculine form lacks the final “t.” However, in a feminine declension matching the subject “tu” (fille), it ought to end in a hard “t” sound: i.e. “presente.” Thus, I have selected to retain the “te” in the expanded form of the contraction. Furthermore, the use of “presente” is in keeping with the repeated use of the term “presente” in the following lines. Such repetition is in line with similarly repetitive structures found throughout the prologue.

[^2]: This instance of “maniere” most likely makes reference to the authors practice of translation: “par tele maniere” found in a preceding line.
